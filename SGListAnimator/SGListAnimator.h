/**
 * This class provides animated transitions for your table and colletion views
 * It assumes that section titles are unique, and that item objects (the model
 * objects that correspond to table view rows or collection view items) are
 * suitable for inclusion in a NSSet. This just means they should implement
 * -hash and -isEqual appropriately.
 *
 * You can use one of the convenience class methods with your own backing arrays,
 * or create a SGListAnimator object that manages your backing data for you, invoking
 * -transitionTableViewToSections: on it whenever you have updated backing data. The latter
 * approach is required to enable support for any of the various types of animated moves;
 * see those properties below.

//     - Assign your table or collection view to the appropriate property below.
//     - Use your list animator's -currentSections array in all your data source methods.
//     - Use -transitionTableViewToSections: or -transitionCollectionViewToSections: each
//       time you have updated backing data.
