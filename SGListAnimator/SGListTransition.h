 * Used by SGListAnimator internally to represent a transition of a table
 * or collection view from one state to another. Defined
 * by a before state (fromSections), and after state (toSections), and
 * the operations that are required to go from before to after. Normally,
 * client code sets fromSections and toSections, then invokes -computeOperations
 * to fill in the operations.
 *
 * Our operations correspond to the method calls that will need to be made on the table
 * or collection view to take it to its new state. Section indices and index paths are
 * valid in either the old or the new state, as indicated by the property name.
